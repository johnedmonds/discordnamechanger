# Introduction

Randomly assigns League of Legends champion names to people in voice channels in your discord server. Avoids giving people the name of the champion they are currently playing.

# Installation

1. [Install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)
2. Create your discord bot account. Discord will give you a token. Put that token in `token.txt` in this directory (next to `Cargo.toml`).
  3. Make sure you've added the discord bot to your server.

# Running
```
cargo run
```
